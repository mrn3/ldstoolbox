  <h3>Welcome to LDS Toolkit!</h3>
  <p>
    LDS Toolkit is a suite of tools that augment tools already available through LDS Tools, Leader and Clerk Resourced (LCR), and lds.org.
  </p>
  <p>
    These tools make it easier for various leaders in wards to function more efficiently. The tools include:
  </p>
  <p>
    <ul>
      <li>Sacrament Program (agenda, printing, and discussion)</li>
      <li>Callings (recommended calling submission and workflow)</li>
      <li>Tithing Settlement (signups and scheduling)</li>
      <li>Home and Visiting Teaching (scheduling and reporting)</li>
    </ul>
  </p>
  <p>
