        <h3>About LDS Toolbox</h3>
        <p>
          LDS Toolbox is a suite of tools that augment tools already available through LDS Tools, Leader and Clerk Resourced (LCR), and lds.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          These tools make it easier for various leaders in wards to function more efficiently. The tools include:
        </p>

            <li>Sacrament Program (agenda, printing, and discussion)</li>
            <li>Callings (recommended calling submission and workflow)</li>
            <li>Tithing Settlement (signups and scheduling)</li>
            <li>Home and Visiting Teaching (scheduling and reporting)</li>
          </ul>
