LDS Toolbox is an open-source, real-time suite of tools for members of the LDS Church built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and based on [Meteoric Ionic](https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic) as a template.  It also makes use of [ldsorgjs](https://github.com/LDSorg/ldsorgjs) for some of the data.

These tools augment tools already available through LDS Tools, Leader and Clerk Resourced (LCR), and lds.org.

Note that LDS Toolbox is distributed under the [MIT License](http://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

If you'd like to be part of the project, please see if there's anything you can help with and let us know.
