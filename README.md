LDS Toolbox is an open-source, real-time suite of tools for members of the LDS Church built with [Meteor](http://meteor.com) and based on [Meteoric Ionic](https://github.com/meteoric/meteor-ionic) as a template.  It also makes use of the [lds.org API Documentation](https://github.com/LDSorg/lds.org-api-documentation) for some of the data.  

These tools augment tools already available through LDS Tools, Leader and Clerk Resourced (LCR), and lds.org.

If you'd like to be part of the project, please see if there's anything you can help with and let us know.  Also, feel free to view/submit [issues] (https://github.com/mrn3/ldstoolbox/issues) and [milestones](https://github.com/mrn3/ldstoolbox/milestones).
